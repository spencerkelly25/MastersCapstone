This was an effort among myself, Jordyn Gulle, Cora Tucker, and Billy Rowe during our second semester in the UGA MSBA program.
We designed an application in Shiny to deliver grading and visualizations on how good individual managers were at apporoving time cards correctly.
The data provided with the application hase been anonymized to protect the identities of the individuals who are working or have worked at the company we consulted for.
